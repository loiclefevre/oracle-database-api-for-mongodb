#Oracle Database API for MongoDB - On-Premises example

This repository contains a getting started example to deploy 2 Testcontainers:
- one with a _free_ Oracle database 21c eXpress Edition
- one with a _free_ Oracle REST Data Services 22.3 installation configured to run the new Oracle database API for MongoDB

Both containers are deployed within one Network. This allows for __reusing__ the containers and speed-up second, third... runs.
